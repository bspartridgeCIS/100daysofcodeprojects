Moving the log from my one that was forked from 100 Days of Code Repository to an Origional Repository so that I can map my progress.

Day 1: July 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I did an hours worth of JavaScript in Free Code Camp. I was almost all about strings. 

**Thoughts:** I am really hoping that once we put this into practice it will make sense. As of right now I don't understand what we would ever use strings for in a functional world. I really want to be good at programming, buwe4k,

Starting Over.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Setting up Git-hub. As I am new to coding in general this is suprisingly challenging as I have never really thouched it before. I also started my Personal Portfolio for the Free Code Camp projects. I am dumbfounded by all the awesome ones people have built, I definitly am overwhlemed about where to start. We didn't actually learn that much yet so it is confusing where people are finding what does what. For example everyone is using " <div class="navbar navbar-default navbar-fixed-top" role="navigation">" Great....but how did you know that makes a nav bar...did you just google it?

**Thoughts:** Jumping into Github I already feel like I am learning a second language. I hope that this becomes second nature quickly.


Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I continued to work on my personl portfolio page for freecodecamp. I pretty much got my name and links to all my social media accoutns. I figured out how to find the icons for thinks like linkedin, twitter ect to add to my code.

**Thoughts:** I still don't fully unsderstand this project, or how to learn HTML, but I will show up again tomorrow.

Day 3: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started over on my personal portfolio. Learning how to do it correctly from the beginning. Found some really good youtube videos that are helping. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2klCZXwfvLs&t=62s Thank Goodness. I think I finally understand fonts!

**Thoughts:** I showed up today. I really was frustrated yesterday but I showed up today. I will get there through youtube and books.

Day 5: January 7, 2017

Worked in Swift Studio with Byte because it is fun and he is so freaking cute.

Day 6: I beat the STUPID background picture:

This CSS:
.pageone {
  background-image: url("https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1453847668862-487637052f8a?dpr=1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1400&h=1000&q=80&cs=tinysrgb&crop="); 
  backgroud-size:cover;
  height: 880px
  
  Took me so so so so so long. and I am still not 100% sure what I am doing.
